# Scraper Migration Summary

## What Was Done

### 1. Consolidated Scraper
- Created `smite_scraper.py` - a single, simplified scraper that replaces the old multi-file system
- Two-stage scraping process:
  - Stage 1: Items (including relics, consumables, etc.)
  - Stage 2: Gods and their abilities
- Outputs directly to the correct directories:
  - JSON data: `../src/data/json/`
  - Images: `../assets/` (with subdirectories for gods, items, abilities)

### 2. Data Structure Updates
- Added `tags` field to Item struct (Vec<ItemTag> enum)
- Added optional fields to God struct:
  - `pantheon: String`
  - `title: String`
  - `image_path: String`
- Added `image_path: String` to Ability struct
- All fields use `#[serde(default)]` for backward compatibility

### 3. Cleaned Up Old Files
Removed:
- `unified_scraper.py` (old complex scraper)
- `consolidate_*.py` scripts
- `transform_data.py`
- Various other old scrapers
- Old output directories

Kept:
- `smite_scraper.py` (new consolidated scraper)
- `test_scraper_simple.py` (for testing data structure)
- `requirements.txt`
- `README.md`

### 4. Data Compatibility
- All existing data (130 gods, 647 abilities, 123 items) is compatible
- Items now have proper tags (Tier1-4, Consumable, Evolved, Glyph, Starter, Relic, Shard)
- The scraper will ADD missing fields when run (pantheon, title, roles, image_path)

## To Run the Scraper

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the scraper
python smite_scraper.py

# With options
python smite_scraper.py --delay 1.0 --verbose
```

## Notes
- The scraper couldn't be fully tested due to missing Python dependencies in the environment
- Data structure compatibility was verified
- All Rust structs have been updated to match the scraper output
- Backup of old data saved in `/home/jakeo/proj/grappul/backup/`
